This document is the explanation and discussion of Lab1_AppX:
(1)Three classic class features:Combination,Inheritance,Polymorphic
their orders are fixed:combination is the basic of inheritance,and inheritance is the basic of polymorphic

there are totally 5+1 classes in Lab1:
Student|Graduate|Undergraduate|StudentWrapper|Class|AppX

Let's talk about their relationships:
1.Student
Student is the base class of Graduate and Undergraduate.(Inheritance)

Student is the private data member of StudentWrapper.(Combination)

Student is a formal parameter of Class's member function.
It has no direct relationship with Class.The bridge connected between them is StudentWapper.

Student's address is the element in AppX's private data member:vector<Students*> studentVec.
AppX uses Student* to accomplish polymorphic(Polymorphic)

Besides,Student is an abstract class which can not instantiate.(Abstract Class)
there is no Student obj.
Graduate and Undergraduate obj have Student obj part and can work as a Student obj.

2.Graduate
Graduate is a derived class from Student.(Inheritance)

Graduate has the same status in lab1_AppX as Undergraduate.

Graduate is a derived class from Student and is not Students itself,
but when the formal parameter is Student obj or its quote,Graduate obj can still be the actual parameter.
the function will use the base class part of the derived class.
We can use Graduate obj to initialise a StudentWrapper obj.

Graduate can be the actual parameter of Class' member function.
It has no direct relationship with Class.The bridge connected between them is StudentWrapper.

Graduate is the actual element in AppX's private data member:vactor<Student*> studentVec.
AppX uses the pointer pointing at the Student part in Graduate to accomplish polymorphic.

3.Undergraduate
Totally same as Graduate.

4.StudentWrapper
StudentWrapper accept both Graduate and Undergraduate obj as its initialisation parameter.

StudentWrapper is the element in Class's private data member:vector<StudentWrapper> students.

5.Class
Class maybe take Graduate obj or Undergraduate obj to form a StudentWrapper.
But storing StudentWrapper obj is the only way to store student information in Class.
In a word,Class doesn't know the student degree
Class only knows each student's id and score of this class.

6.AppX
AppX integrates all the classes above.
It interacts with the user directly.

(2)Working principles
this lab works in the following routine:

First,you should put the Students.txt and Classes.txt in the working directory of the program.

Second,AppX's constructor function automatically call the loadFiles function.
loadFiles function reads the information of Students.txt and Classes.txt.

Thirdly,loadFiles function use the information in Students.txt to form Graduate obj or Undergraduate obj.
And then push them into the studentVec.

Fourly,loadFiles function use the information:classname and point in Classes.txt to form new Class.
And push them into the classVec.
And loadFiles use the id of student list in Classes.txt to do 3 things:
(1)to find whether there is the corresponding student in studentVec(it has got fully initialized) or not by id.
(2)if the corresponding student exists,calls the addStudent function(it accepts Student&) in Class to add this student.
This initializes the Class's private data member:students.
And calls the addClass function (It accepts Class*) in Student to add this class.
This initializes the Student's private data member:classes.
(3)if the corresponding student does not exist,do nothing(ignore)

Fifthly,AppX's inputScore function reads the classname user inputs.
and find out whether there is such class in classVec.
If there is the right class,inputScore function continue to read id and scores.
If not,inputScore function use std::cerr to report an error:No Match Class!
And then return back to the former step:reads the next classname. 

If inputScore reads the right classname:
It will read id and scores user inputs,
and then uses id to find the corresponding student.
If this student exists,it will use this id to get the corresponding StudentWrapper,
then use setScore in StudentWrapper to initialize this student's score.
(only StudentWrapper obj can store student's scores)
If this student does not exist,it will use std::cerr to report an error:No Match Student!
And then return back the former step:reads the next id and scores.

Sixthly,AppX's printScoreStats function will get the classname and check whether this class exists in classVec.
If the class does not exist,it will throw an error to be catched:No Match Class!
If the class exists,it will call the three functions:
1.double getHighestScore();
2.double getLowestScore();
3.double getAvgScore();
they will traverse this class(Class obj)'s private data member,
std::vector<StudentWrapper> students,to traverse each student's score and check its legality.
If the student's score is between [0,100],then it counts.
If the student's score is -1(means illegal scores,agreed in advance),then skip it.
If every student's score is illegal,throw:"No Valid Score!"
Otherwise,throw the legal scores.

Seventhly,AppX's printGrade function will get the student's id and check whether this student exists in studentVec.
If the student does not exist,throw:"No Match Student!"
else it will call the two functions in Graduate/Undergraduate:
1.double getGpa();
2.double getAvgScore();
they will traverse this student(Graduate/Undergraduate obj)'s private data member,
std::vector<Class*> classes,to traverse each class and call getStudentWrapper in Class to check scores and legality.
If the student's score is between [0,100],then it counts,so does the gpa.
If the student's score is -1(means illegal scores,agreed in advance),then skip it.
If every student's score is illegal,return 0.0
Otherwise,throw the legal scores and gpa.
Graduate and Undergraduate obj have different methods to get their gpa.
This can reflect the Polymorphic between different derived classes.

Eighthly,AppX's saveScore function will set down all the classes and their students' id and scores.
It will traverse each class in vector<Class*>classVec with an iterator and for each of class,
call its own save function:saveScore in Class.
As the traverse ends,each class and its student id and scores are save in scores.txt.

Attention:if the student wants to know its score,it has to find Class obj at std::vector<Class*> classes at first,
then calls the Class obj's getStudentWrapper at second,
and calls getScore in StudentWrapper at last
Only StudentWrapper obj has scores.


This is the entire working process and principles of the AppX.
I hope this will help you understand the whole process and learn how to code.
